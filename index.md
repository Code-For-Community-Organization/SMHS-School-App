**SMHS Schedule** is an app made for viewing Santa Margarita Catholic High School's schedule, much better than the official SMHS app. **SMHS Schedule** is made by a SMHS student, for SMHS students, and aims to deliver a beautiful and native app experience. 

SMHS Schedule is also written in SwiftUI, 100% open source. Contributing is welcome on the GitHub repo [page](https://github.com/jevonmao/SMHS-Schedule).
