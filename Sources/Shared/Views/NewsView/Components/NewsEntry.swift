SMCHS students had the unique opportunity to participate in virtual masterclasses with renowned professors. Hailed as the Paganini of the steel drum, Professor Liam Teague is the Professor of Music and Head of Steelpan Studies at Northern Illinois University and a former college professor of Ms. Duncan, percussion teacher. Professor Jamie Whitmarsh is a composer, conductor and percussionist. He is composition faculty at Oklahoma City University and Principal Timpanist of the Oklahoma City Philharmonic.
        
Teague worked with a steel drums class on a piece he wrote. The piece will be performed at the Nick Kraus Memorial Scholarship Concert on Sunday, May 23 at 7:00 p.m. in the Moiso Family Pavillion. Teague also worked with four student soloists, Lizzie Dilao '21, Allie Sadoff '22, Emily Horn '21 and Raj Pai '22. Professor Teague and Professor Whitmarsh worked with the symphony orchestra. Dr. Clarino, Instrumental Music Teacher and Band Director, conducted the orchestra while Ms. Duncan was the soloist.

Both professors worked with the students on musicality and technique while providing invaluable feedback.

"It was such a pleasure being able to work with these students. I am deeply passionate about the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago - the steelpan - and having these types of opportunities to speak to these young ambassadors is so important,‚Äù said Teague.
